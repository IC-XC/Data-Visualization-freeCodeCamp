## Visualizing data using charts, graphs, and maps is one of the most impactful ways to communicate complex data. 

A data visualization is a graphical representation of data or information—for example, taking raw numbers from a spreadsheet and transforming that into a bar or line chart. Using data visualizations helps you to easily understand and analyze trends and outcomes within your data.

Selecting the right graphical representation depends on the story you are trying to tell. You can choose any visualization and assume it’ll do the trick, but it’s worth the time and effort to select and customize the right visualization for long-lasting impact.

Where do you put data visualizations? Data visualizations are everywhere: on the evening news, embedded in tweets, or on the front page of the newspaper. In a business context, you often find data visualizations in reports, presentations, or on a business dashboard.
